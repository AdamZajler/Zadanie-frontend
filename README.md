# Zadanie rekrutacyjne

In the text below you can find information about instlating repo, used technologies or my comment about this project üòä

## How to install ‚ùì

It's simple. Just download repository, run `npm i` and after installation, type in your terminal `npm start`

### Used technologies

- React
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS

### Why project is like this ‚ùì

Unfortunetly because of my limited avilable time in this weekend (renovation & a lot of overtime in work) I could only provide project like this. 
In my free time I'm learning Next.js, and my small private project ‚ò∫ (headless CMS based on WP/GraphQL/SSR).

Thanks to this recrutation progress I found out that I forgot few things from React and I systematized my knwoladge about it. I was absorbed in Next.js and my current work (CMS like WP/PrestaShop/Shopify) that I practicly forgot about few things in React hah.

It is the same like with all things, 'you need to have commercial experience to better understand and get used to new technology' ~ said someone somewhere

If I have more free time, I would definetly add `memo method` to optimize app | propably changed file structure to more like it is done in the Next.js; and if I would have a loooot more of free time I would use Next + Wordpress + Woocommerce or builder.io to have more fun with this project üòÅ
